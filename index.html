        <p class="intro-text lead mb-0">
          As someone new to Austin, exploring coffee shops has become my way of getting familiar with the city and finding places I love. I am always excited to try somewhere new, and these shops are my top 10 favorites so far. Each one has something special to offer, whether it is a comfortable study space, great coffee, or a friendly atmosphere.<br>Each entry includes where the shop is located, a short description of what makes it unique, and a link to Google Maps so you can easily visit for yourself. I hope you enjoy these places as much as I do.
